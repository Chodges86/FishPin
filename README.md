# Fish Pin

Fish Pin is an app that allows fisherman to record their catches and useful data.  Then view and filter their records to re-create previous successes 

The app uses Firebase Auth for user login which then takes the user to a map using MapKit that uses custom MKAnnotation points to show previous catches.  The user can filter this data to decide where to fish and what lures to use to re-create previous success.
